Xray Xpress is an AI-enabled programme that assists radiologists in simplifying and automating patient setup and image acquisition process. It helps in identifying the specific part of human body via camera and thus helping the technician to take image without any retakes and further it can also flag/detect any anamolies if present.
Also, this application is helpful for the surgeon during orthopaedics operation as surgeon can control GUI operations using hand gestures standing away from the display screen.
